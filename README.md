# About
ProteiNN is a Transformer network trained to predict end-to-end single-sequence protein structure by amino acid sequences. To find out more, check out the provided research paper:

* "Deep Learning for Protein Structure Prediction: Advancements in Structural Bioinformatics" (DOI: [10.1101/2023.04.26.538026](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.26.538026))
* Also contained in the "PaperAndPresentation" folder is the research paper.

# Usage
Run main.py to choose from either "train" or "predict" modes; train will retrain the model and predict will provide users the option to enter an amino acid sequence to predict the structure of (which will be output as a PDB file).

# Bugs/Features
Bugs are tracked using the GitHub Issue Tracker.

Please use the issue tracker for the following purpose:
  * To raise a bug request; do include specific details and label it appropriately.
  * To suggest any improvements in existing features.
  * To suggest new features or structures or applications.
